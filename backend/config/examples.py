- Communication skills
- Motor skills
- Behavioral/emotional functioning
- Adaptive behavior

**Clinical Documentation**: Provide relevant medical records, developmental history, and diagnostic reports to support referral.

**NC Medicaid Coverage**:
Medications must be FDA-approved for specific indications and medically necessary. Common covered categories include:
- Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole) for irritability/aggression
- SSRIs for co-morbid anxiety/OCD
- Stimulants/atomoxetine for co-morbid ADHD
- Sleep medications for documented sleep disorders

**Prior Authorization**: May be required for certain medications. Submit clinical documentation supporting medical necessity.

**Important Clinical Considerations**:
- No medications are FDA-approved to treat core autism symptoms
- Pharmacotherapy targets specific behavioral or psychiatric co-morbidities
- Evidence-based behavioral interventions remain first-line treatment

**Recommendation**: Consult patient's insurance formulary and prior authorization requirements. Consider referral to developmental-behavioral pediatrician or child psychiatrist for medication management.

This is general information only. Prescribing decisions must be based on individual patient assessment and clinical judgment."""

**Step 1: Write a Letter**
Send a letter to your child's school principal asking for an evaluation. You can say something like: "I am requesting a full evaluation for my child under IDEA to see if they qualify for special education services."

**Step 2: The School Responds**
The school has 10 days to respond to your request. They'll set up a meeting to discuss the evaluation.

**Step 3: Give Permission**
You'll sign a consent form allowing the school to evaluate your child. This is your right as a parent.

**Step 4: Evaluation Happens**
The school has 90 days to complete the evaluation. They'll look at your child's learning, behavior, and other areas.

**What Happens Next?**
After the evaluation, the school will meet with you to discuss if your child qualifies for an IEP.

**You're Not Alone**: If you need help with this process, the NC Autism Society can guide you: 1-800-442-2762.

**Important First Step**: Talk to your child's doctor before starting any medication. They know your child's specific needs.

**What Insurance Usually Covers**:
Most NC Medicaid and insurance plans cover medications that help with:
- Behavior challenges (like aggression or irritability)
- Anxiety or repetitive behaviors
- Sleep problems
- ADHD symptoms that happen with autism

**How to Find Out What's Covered**:
1. Call the number on the back of your insurance card
2. Ask about "autism-related medication coverage"
3. Ask if you need "prior authorization" (approval before getting the medication)

**What to Know About Medications**:
- There's no medication that "treats" autism itself
- Medications can help with specific challenges your child faces
- Therapy and behavioral support are still very important

**Need Help?**
- Your child's doctor can work with insurance for you
