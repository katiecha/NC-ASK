They can connect you to programs like the Innovations Waiver and 1915(i) services, which offer home- and community-based supports, respite and crisis services. To find your LME/MCO, use the state directory or call 1-855-262-1946. You do not need to know the program names in advance—describe your child's needs, and the LME/MCO will explain the options and help you apply.\n\nWould you like help finding the phone number for your county's LME/MCO or learning how to apply for Medicaid if you aren't already enrolled?",

Your LME/MCO can tell you which program fits your situation and help you join the Innovations waitlist or apply for 1915(i) services.\n\nAre you currently enrolled in Medicaid, or would you like guidance on how to get coverage so you can access these services?",
