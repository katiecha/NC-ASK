## Tips for Better Results

### Make Your Questions Specific

**Instead of:** "Services for autism"
**Try:** "What occupational therapy services accept Medicaid for children with autism in Wake County?"

### Include Relevant Details

- Age group (toddler, child, teen, adult)
- Location (city, county, or region)
- Specific needs (therapy, education, social, financial)

### One Question at a Time

Ask one clear question rather than multiple questions in one message.

**Instead of:** "Where are therapies and schools and how do I pay and what about adults?"
**Try asking separately:**
1. "What therapy options are available for children with autism in Greensboro?"
2. "How can I find autism-friendly schools in Guilford County?"
3. "What funding options help pay for autism therapy in NC?"

### Follow-Up Questions

You can ask follow-up questions to get more specific information:

**First question:** "What is the NC Innovations Waiver?"
**Follow-up:** "How do I apply for the NC Innovations Waiver in Mecklenburg County?"

### Verify Important Information

- Always click on citations to verify information
- Check that sources are current (look at publication dates)
- Contact organizations directly for the most up-to-date details
- Confirm eligibility and requirements before applying

<a name="limitations-providers"></a>
## Limitations and Disclaimers

### System Limitations

**NC-ASK is NOT:**

**A diagnostic tool**
- Cannot diagnose autism spectrum disorder
- Cannot assess developmental delays
- Cannot interpret diagnostic test results

**A treatment decision tool**
- Cannot recommend specific treatments for individual patients
- Cannot compare treatment efficacy for specific cases
- Cannot provide medication guidance

**Real-time or comprehensive**
- Knowledge base updated periodically (not continuously)
- May not include all available resources
- May not reflect recent program changes

**A substitute for clinical judgment**
- Cannot replace your expertise and assessment

### When NOT to Use NC-ASK

**Do not rely on NC-ASK for:**
- Emergency or crisis situations
- Time-sensitive clinical decisions
- Diagnostic determinations

**Use established clinical protocols and consultation for these scenarios.**

### AI-Specific Limitations

**Potential AI Issues:**

1. **Hallucination Risk**: AI may occasionally generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate information
   - **Mitigation**: Always verify through citations
   - Check source documents for critical information

2. **Context Limitations**: AI may not fully understand complex, nuanced queries

   - **Mitigation**: Review citation quality
   - Supplement with your own knowledge and research

4. **No Clinical Reasoning**: AI synthesizes information but doesn't apply clinical judgment
   - **Mitigation**: Interpret responses through your clinical lens
   - Consider patient-specific factors AI cannot know

### Legal and Professional Disclaimer

**NC-ASK is an informational tool only.**

- Not approved as a medical device
- Not validated for clinical decision support
- Not a substitute for professional consultation

## Privacy and Compliance

### Patient Privacy Protection

**NC-ASK is designed with privacy by default:**

**No Personal Health Information (PHI) Required or Collected**
- No patient names
- No medical record numbers
- No dates of birth
- No specific diagnoses beyond what you choose to include in queries
- No treatment history

**Queries are anonymized:**
- System does not link queries to individual providers
- No login required (in most deployments)
- No tracking of user identity

### HIPAA Considerations

**NC-ASK and HIPAA:**

**Safe to use for general queries:**
- "What ABA providers serve Medicaid patients in Wake County?"
- "What are eligibility requirements for NC Innovations Waiver?"

**DO NOT include PHI in queries:**
- Do not include patient names
- Do not include medical record numbers
- Do not include specific identifying information
- Do not include detailed case histories

**Example - HIPAA Compliant Query:**
> "What transition planning resources are available for an 18-year-old with autism and moderate intellectual disability in Guilford County?"

**Example - Contains PHI (Do Not Use):**
> ~~"Where can I refer John Smith (DOB 1/15/2006, MRN 123456) who has autism and ID in Greensboro?"~~

### Data Logging

**What is logged (for system improvement and safety):**
- Queries asked (anonymized, no user identity)
- Crisis keyword detection events
- General usage statistics

**What is NOT logged:**
- User identity
- IP addresses (in privacy-focused deployments)
- Personal health information
- Patient identifiers

**Crisis Logging:**
If a query triggers crisis detection keywords, the system logs this for safety auditing purposes, but still without linking to user identity.

### Institutional Compliance

**For institutional deployments:**
- Consult your institution's IT and compliance teams
- Review your institution's AI usage policies
- Ensure NC-ASK deployment meets your security requirements
- Follow institutional protocols for clinical decision support tools

**Recommended:** Treat NC-ASK queries similar to searching public medical databases (PubMed, UpToDate) - use for information gathering, not for transmitting PHI.
